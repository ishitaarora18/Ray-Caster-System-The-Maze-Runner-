# Ray-Caster-System-The-Maze-Runner-

Maze Runner is an endeavor focused on the implementation of 3D visualization techniques to render 2D maps using OpenGL. The project aims to elucidate fundamental principles of computer graphics through the practical application of spatial representation and rendering methodologies.

Core Objectives:  
•	Dynamic Environment Representation: The project revolves around the creation of a dynamic environment, characterized by a grid-based layout representing 2D maps. This grid-based representation enables the differentiation between solid boundaries (walls) and navigable spaces.  
•	Interactive Player Navigation: Users interact with the environment via intuitive keyboard controls, facilitating real-time manipulation of the player's viewpoint. This interactive component enables exploration and experimentation within the simulated environment.  
•	Visualization of Spatial Relationships: A pivotal aspect of the project involves the visual representation of spatial relationships within the 2D maps. By employing 3D visualization techniques, the project provides users with a realistic portrayal of the environment, enhancing their understanding of spatial configurations.  

Technical Framework:  
The project leverages OpenGL, a cross-platform graphics API renowned for its versatility and efficiency in rendering 2D and 3D graphics. By harnessing OpenGL's capabilities, the project achieves real-time rendering performance, crucial for simulating dynamic environments and responsive user interactions.

Methodology:  
The foundation of this project rests upon a robust algorithm capable of traversing the environment and detecting intersections with spatial elements. Through iterative propagation and collision detection mechanisms, the algorithm determines visibility and occlusion, enabling the generation of realistic 3D visualizations of the 2D maps.
